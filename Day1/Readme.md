## Typescript Intro
 TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript code. 
 It was developed by Microsoft and is open-source software. TypeScript adds optional static typing, classes, interfaces, and other object-oriented programming features to JavaScript, making it easier to write and maintain large-scale applications.

**Some key benefits of using TypeScript include:**

- Static type checking: TypeScript helps catch type-related errors before runtime, making it easier to debug and maintain code.
- Improved code organization: TypeScript's object-oriented programming features, such as classes and interfaces, help developers write cleaner, more organized code.
- Improved tooling: TypeScript integrates well with popular code editors and development tools, providing better autocomplete, refactoring, and debugging capabilities.
- Interoperability with JavaScript: TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, which means that existing JavaScript code can be easily integrated into TypeScript projects.
- To install TypeScript, you need to have Node.js installed on your machine. Here are the steps to install TypeScript using npm (Node Package Manager):

**Open a terminal or command prompt.**
Install TypeScript globally by running the following command: **npm install -g typescript**
Check the TypeScript version by running the following command: **tsc -v**
chek the output of your code via terminal by installing ts-node with **yarn add ts-node -D** and run **ts-node <file name>** to view
That's it! You now have TypeScript installed on your machine and can start using it to write better, more maintainable JavaScript code.
